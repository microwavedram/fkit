        Hey there, this is a short message from the fKit developer.
        Just want everyone who uses this to understand why it was made,
        and my annoyance with other frameworks.

        fKit was made from a combination between:
         - boredom
         - annoyance with other frameworks
         - dislike of obfuscation

        fKit is currently open source and always will be.
        as a developer myself, I find the fact that obfuscation is required for anything
        of value in this day and age particually annoying. Obfuscation helps no one but those
        who make money off it. I could have very easily obfuscated this whole
        framework and started forcing people to buy it with excessive amounts of money, however
        I believe that this is the wrong approch as it prevents you (a developer)
        from building upon this framework and spinning it to your requirements.

        Thank You
